#Pledges <small>For buying big things!</small>
---

Pledges are to buy things that the Makerspace couldn't buy under normal circumstances, or have been requested by a minority.  
Under these circumstances you must set-up a pledge, make a page detail what you would like to buy and how much it will cost.  
Speak to the Committee and the Group will decide an amount of money to give towards the pledge, the rest of the money must be raised by getting other members to support the pledge.  

For example, Bob wants to buy a golden screwdriver, it will cost £200. The group doesn't want to buy it, but a few members do. Bob sets up a pledge, the group says it will give £50 towards the pledge. Bob then convinces Bill to put £20 towards the pledge. After a few more people to join his pledge, Bob raises the money to buy his screwdriver.
