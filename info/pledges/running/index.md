#Running a Pledge

###Before starting a pledge
-Check that there is demand for the item you wish to buy on the wishlist and with the group on IRC/mailing list/etc.  
-Ask around, you may find that a member already has a similar item that they'll be willing to donate.  
-Check with the committee, we'll rarely say no but do tell us!  
-If you think there is suitable demand then set up a pledge.  

###Setting up the pledge
-Pull the site repo and create a pledge page, you can use [this template](../template).  
-Add a link to your pledge on the pledges page.  
-Submit a pull request.  
-Notify people about your pledge, make sure to add the names and amounts of each pledge to your page.  

###Collecting money
Well done - you've reached your target! Soon you can buy things. First you need to get the money together:  
-Approach the treasurer (or the committee in general) with a list of members supporting your pledge and how much they owe, all members must pay the treasurer.  
-The group will now purchase what you requested.
