###Meetings
We hold our meetings every Tuesday from 19:30 – 22:00 at [Galleywood Scout Hut](https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&ll=51.702403,0.478308&spn=0.001805,0.005252&t=h&z=18), we simply ask you to bring a small donation of £2.50 if you attend.  
If you want to come and work on a project, have a chat and a coffee or just see what it’s all about you’re welcome.

**Note:** If coming by car do not park in the main park car park, this closes at 8PM and so your car will be trapped until the morning. Instead use the driveway outside the scout hut.

We don't have any fixed rules at the moment, but common sense does apply.

###Workshops
Workshops are organised by our members, they are announced on the mailing list, blog, Facebook, Twitter and the Workshops page. Most workshops are free but we encourage people to donate to the upkeep of the space. It's also worth noting that some of these workshops will have limited places or other constraints so make sure you check.  

Non-members are welcome to attend any workshop or event run by Chelmsford Makerspace, and the charges for these are detailed in advance.
