# Membership #

If you’d like to become a member contact us at <contact@chelmsfordmakerspace.co.uk> for more information.

We hold our meetings every Tuesday from 19:30 – 22:00 at [Galleywood Scout Hut](https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&ll=51.702403,0.478308&spn=0.001805,0.005252&t=h&z=18), we simply ask you to bring a small donation of £2.50 if you attend.  
If you want to come and work on a project, have a chat and a coffee or just see what it’s all about you’re welcome.

Note: If coming by car do not park in the main park car park, this closes at 8PM and so your car will be trapped until the morning. Instead use the driveway outside the scout hut.

Non-members are welcome to attend any workshop or event run by Chelmsford Makerspace, and the charges for these are detailed in advance.
