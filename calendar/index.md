#####Thursday the 9th May, 7pm - 8pm at the [<span class="label hub">Ideas Hub</span>](http://ideashubchelmsford.org/)

In this workshop we'll be showing you how to make the most of your smartphone. Starting by working out what everyone already knows and what they would like to know. Then going into detail about topics such as messaging, documents, music, video and photos.
