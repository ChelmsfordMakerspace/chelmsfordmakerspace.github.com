Chelmsford Makerspace is a non-profit, community-run workshop in Chelmsford.  
We provide a space where people who make things can come to share tools and knowledge.

We hold meetings every Tuesday from 7:30pm â€“ 10:00pm at the [Galleywood Scout Hut](https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&ll=51.702403,0.478308&spn=0.001805,0.005252&t=h&z=18).
