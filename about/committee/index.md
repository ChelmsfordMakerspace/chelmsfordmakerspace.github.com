#Committee
The Makerspace is run by volunteers. Although any member can vote and have input into the group, a number of individuals are assigned duties, this is the Committee.  
Each committee member takes responsibility for a particular area listed in the table below. Either of these can be your first port of call if you want to discuss a particular issue.  

Just because committee members handle a particular area, please don't assume that means you can't do things. Plenty of members care and want to help out with stuff, and the makerspace is fundamentally quite a permissive space. The reason these roles exist is just to provide a level of awareness and coordination between different aspects of the space.

**Ben Orrin**: Chairman  
**Richard Raybould**: Infrastructure  
**Sue Raybould**: Treasury and Accounts  
**Ben Heaysman**: Tools and Materials   
**Ross Bishop**
