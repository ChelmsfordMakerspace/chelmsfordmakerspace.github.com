Chelmsford Makerspace is a non-profit, community-run hackerspace in Chelmsford.  
We provide a space where people who make things can come to share tools and knowledge.  
The group is governed by a [committee](committee).

Basicly we have a ‘space’ where we all get together, socialise and create things!  
We have cool tools, cool people (with lots of knowledge) and its fun!

The Space is inspired by many ‘hackerspaces’ and ‘makerspaces’ in the USA and Europe, a place where likeminded people can come together to socialise, create and have fun.  
We can use membership fees to buy equipment and materials that people otherwise wouldn’t have had access to, we can bring many people together to share their knowledge with others, and learn from others.

We aim to foster a community of makers by providing an environment in terms of people, equipment and space that supports the creative process and personal growth. Modern software, the Internet and economies of scale have all come together to allow ordinary people with a little bit of know-how to begin blurring the lines between manufacturer and consumer.  
With some effort and the help of a growing community of makers it is possible for a lone individual to make things of amazing quality and functionality.  
Makerspaces that act as hubs for the maker community are popping up all over the world.

In our space you’ll find people into electronics, robots, wood working, embedded software, metal working, music, art, video, photography, electric cars and much more.  
We’ve found that having such people pursuing their interests in close proximity to one another leads to a lot of productively, personal satisfaction and some amazing collaborative projects.  
We hope you’ll become be a part of it.
