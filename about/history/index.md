#History

##Pre-Makerspace  
###2008
Richard, Ben and Alex (as well as a few occasional others) hold 'regular' meetings or LAN partys every month or so. Food is eaten, games are played, lulz are had.  
###2010
First Trip to Eurogamer Expo. 'Core Group' expands.  
###2011
Meetings need to be more often, but raiding someone house every week isnt practical.   
###Late 2011
Richard suggests a Hackerspace in Chelmsford, the idea is born.  
The idea is kicked about on Twitter, general consensus is that its a good idea.  
###Late 2011
Original concept is that Hackerspace should be a closed group of friends, start looking for a space. Quickly release a space will not be funded without more people. Idea is shelved over Christmas.  

##Early Days
###Feb 2012
The idea is picked up again, more stuff is bounced around on Twitter and a Facebook page is set-up. Ben H along with others join the group.
