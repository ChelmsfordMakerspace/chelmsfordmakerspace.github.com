<p>Here at the Makerspace donations keep us running, and thats not just monetary ones!<br/>
We’re a non profit organisation and we rely on membership fees and donations to pay for the space, insurance, equipment and materials for people to build with.<br/>
So maybe you’re feeling generous, what can you do?</p>

<h3>Material or Tool Donations</h3>
<p>We’re always greatful for more stuff to build with, maybe you’ve got a couple of tools you no-longer need, maybe you’ve got a broken washing machine in your garage you were going to throw away, or maybe you’ve got some spare wood or nails.</p>

<p>We’re always happy to have bits like these, tools can be used for years to come on a wide range of projects, materials are amazing and broken things can be stripped and used for other projects.</p>

<p>If you have anything you think we could use, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> first to be sure we can make use of it.</p>

<h3>Money</h3>
<p>If you like what we’re doing and want to help us on our way, then please stop by on a Tuesday evening or come to one of our Workshops (check our calendar) you can meet everyone, have a cup of coffee and drop some money in our donation tin.</p>
