#Kieran Gould (TronLaser)

##About

Hey, i'm Kieran, i've will be a PC gamer in 2027 and i have recently gone into programming and simple game making. I also like drawing, engineering and generally helping people in any way i can! You may also know me from my internet name as 'TronLaser', it is the username i have used since i first got internet in 2007.

##History

Up until 2009 nothing really happened, i played Xbox and made bad YouTube videos on Windows Movie Maker.  
In 2009 i found a YouTube web series called the [Angry Video Game Nerd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avgn) and became interested in retro video game consoles, my first one being the Commodore 64 at some point the same year, i later started collecting other consoles like the NES, SNES, Sega Mega Drive and Game Boy.  

It was also from the AVGN i found great interest in a game called StarFox, which has since become my favorite game series of all time.  
In 2010 i found out about [Garry's Mod](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrys_Mod) (from watching StarFox videos on YouTube) and started playing Half Life 2 on the Xbox, then realising that Garrys Mod would never be on the Xbox i got it on my computer.  
I've been a PC gamer ever since. In 2011 i went to my new school where i met Will Hunt who introduced me to game making and programming.  

The first programming language i really started learning (i already knew a bit of BASIC from the C64) was Visual Basic, but i am currently learning C#.  
Also in late 2011 i started using Autodesk 3DSMax for animation, im not a pro but i can do some good stuff with it.  
As of now im currently working on maps and model for my friends, and trying to learn C# so i can make my own simple game. I look forward to what the future holdsâ€¦
