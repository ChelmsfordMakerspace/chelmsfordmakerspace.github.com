##Introduction##

This is my (very small) contribution to Jekyll.

I know a lot of people already know how to run a multi blog site using Jekyll, but in case someone do not, I want to share this with that person.

I'll complete this file once I finish polishing the multi blog site, and it is uploaded here.

Thanks.
