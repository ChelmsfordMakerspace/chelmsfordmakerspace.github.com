title: 'Announcing the Internet of Things workshop at the Ideas Fesival 2013'
---

The introductory workshop will take place upstairs in the [Ideas Hub](http://ideashubchelmsford.org) on the 2nd of November from 4 to 6pm.

Due to the short notice we had on this, content is to be announced but will likely revolve around using boards such as the Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone to make physical devices that interact with online services. We've put the text that appears in the printed guide after the jump.

<div class="panel">Bring code into the physical world with microcontrollers, sensors, servos and lights. In this session we'll be getting hands on with simple electronics to bring the internet to life, connecting the virtual and physical worlds.</div>

Registration is required and will open soon at the [Ideas Festival website](http://changingchelmsford.org/IF2013/).

If you would like to help out with this workshop or show something you've made, please [get in touch](/contact)!
