After many years in development our First meeting will be on Wednesday 4th July. Its in writing! Hopefully it will have been worth the wait.
Meet at Galleywood Scout Hut, and pop in anytime between 7pm and 10pm.

Please try and bring Â£2.50 for the running of the club, its a little high this week, but we're not sure of the turnout.

Bring along food, laptops and whatever you like! We'll be socialising, listening to music, introducing ourselves and having a small planning meeting to get things rolling.

(Galleywood Scout Hut is located in Jubilee Park, just off Watchouse road)

See here (its that building in the park):
