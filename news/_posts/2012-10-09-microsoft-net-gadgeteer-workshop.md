The Workshops showed people how to use the Gadgeteer to quickly prototype new and interesting ideas.

At the workshop we made a fully functioning digital camera in minutes, using the gadgeteer and a few lines of code.

We hopeully plan to run further workshops using the Gadgeteer and obtain some for use at the Makerspace.
