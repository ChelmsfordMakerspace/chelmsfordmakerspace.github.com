This May we're running [Chelmsford Game Jam](http://gamejam.cmspace.org), over the course of a weekend teams and indivduals will be challenge with making a game in 72 hours using anything they can find or bring along.

Anyone is encouraged to come and you can build a game in anything you like. We'd recommend at least some experience with making a game beforehand, even if it's just a drag and drop program.

It's a three day event, running from <strong>Friday 3rd May - Sunday 5th May</strong>, entry is free and food will be provided throughout the day.

You can [register for a ticket](http://cmjam2013.eventbrite.com/), as well as follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CM_Makerspace) or like us on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/ChelmsfordHackerspace) for any future updates.
