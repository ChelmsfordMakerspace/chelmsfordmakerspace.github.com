Our proposed new venue (Galleywood Scout Hut, Jubilee Park) has said that we should be able to get either a Tuesday night or a Wednesday night.

<!--break-->

The reason we have chosen this venue is because it is literally down the road from our previous venue, has very good value prices and has a lot of floor space for us to use. I (Ben O) personally know the chairman of the scout group and so this improves our relations and is happy for us to run the space there.

Please can you respond with which day is preferable to you, whether you think meetings should be weekly or bi-weekly, and what times should be suitable for you.
