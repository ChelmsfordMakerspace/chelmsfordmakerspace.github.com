Earlier this year we attended an event at Anglia Ruskin University called [City Camp Chelmsford](http://citycampchelmsford.wordpress.com/), this was an unconference about how we could go about making Chelmsford a better and safer place.

We went to City Camp and told people about the Makerspace, what we’re doing and what we plan to do in the future and the response that we received was overwhelmingly positive.

We decided to enter into a special CityCamp round of the [Chelmsford Grand Awards](http://www.chelmsfordgrandawards.co.uk/), a scheme which gives £1000 to a given charity or community group in Chelmsford each month.

We are proud to announce that we have won the Chelmsford Grand Awards, a sum of £1000!

Earlier today Richard was able to give a short presentation of how the Makerspace has grown from a gathering of young electronics and engineering enthusiasts in a kitchen to a rapidly growing community.

So what do we plan to do with the money?

Well, firstly we’re putting it toward something which we think will benefit the space longterm, a 3D Printer or RepRap.
We chose this simply because it was something that could be used to print out the parts for many future projects and we could see it being to put good use, not only that but it serves as a great group project, binding the Makerspace together further and so we can say ‘We built that’.
We will be documenting the build of the RepRap on this blog and on our Wiki.

The rest of the money will be spent on kitting out the Makerspace with a basic set of tools such as soldering irons, screwdriver sets etc. as well as being put towards Microcontrollers such as Arduinos and Raspberry Pi’s.

We wanted to make sure the equipment was bought for everyones interests and we think we have achieved that, everything we are spending the grant on has been voted for by our members.
