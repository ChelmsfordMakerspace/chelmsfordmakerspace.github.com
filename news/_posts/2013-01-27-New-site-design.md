In case you haven't noticed, we've overhauled the site design quite a bit!  
Changes include SVG artwork, responsive design based on [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and what I hope is a generally better experience.  

If you'd like to report any issues, please do [here](https://github.com/ChelmsfordMakerspace/chelmsfordmakerspace.github.com/issues?state=open) (alternatively, you can just [contact us](/contact)), as always you can fork and submit pull requests on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ChelmsfordMakerspace/chelmsfordmakerspace.github.com).
