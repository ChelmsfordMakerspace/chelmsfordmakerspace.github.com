A little late on this one but we now have a [Parrot](http://www.parrot.com/uk/) [AR.Drone 2.0](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/) of our own!  
<!--break-->

For [BananaDrone](Bett-and-BananaDrone.html), we were borrowing [Tom Stacey](https://twitter.com/Code_ED)'s personal drone. After that we wanted our own so Tom contacted the UK distributor of them, [Flying Toys](http://www.flyingtoys.com/) to see what he could do.

Fast forward a month or so and Richard got a tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/richardr">richardr</a> I've got something here you want, do dah, do dah. I've got something you want do dah do dah day... ðŸ˜‰</p>&mdash; Tom Stacey(@Code_ED) <a href="https://twitter.com/Code_ED/status/323757455056179203">April 15, 2013</a></blockquote>

So of course, Richard ran over to pick it up.

We've got some AR.Drone hacks in the pipeline already, keep an eye out for any that end up working!
