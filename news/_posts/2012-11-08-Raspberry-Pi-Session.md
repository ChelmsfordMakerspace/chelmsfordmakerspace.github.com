Ever wanted to program computers but didn't know how?  
Well we'll be teaching people (even absolute beginners) how to use and start making things with a Raspberry Pi.  

Come along on to Galleywood Scout Hut (just off Watchouse Road) on 27th November from 7:30 - 10pm  

The costs is free, although we do encourage a contribution of Â£2.50 to pay for the rent of the hall.  
All ages welcome.  

**If travelling by car do NOT park in the main park car park, it shuts at 8 and you will be locked in!**
