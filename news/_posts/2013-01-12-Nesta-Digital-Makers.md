A little while ago, Richard met up with Victoria Mason, the Industry Intelegence Manager for Essex County Council at Chelmsford City Camp.  
After that, she came across and told us about Nesta's Digital Makers fund.  

A long story later and we're applying for the grant to get the makerspace up and out of the Scout Hut.

We've embedded our application video after the break!
